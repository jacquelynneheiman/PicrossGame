# Picross Game

## What is a Picross game?
A Picross game, or Nonograms, is a puzzle game where players use logic to color or leave blank cells in a grid. The objective is to reveal the hidden picture based on clues outside the grid. These clues are numbers that represent the lengths of the consecutive blocks of filled-in cells in each row and column.

How it typically works: 
- Each number in the row and column clues indicates a group of consecutive filled squares in that row or column. Multiple numbers mean multiple groups are separated by at least one blank square.
- Players determine which squares should be filled in and which should remain empty using these clues.
- Correctly solving the puzzle reveals the hidden image, representing anything from simple shapes to complex pictures.

The appeal of Picross games lies in the challenge of deducing the solution using logic, making them both engaging and rewarding brain exercises.
